Janson,

Thank you for agreeing to use this platform for our communications. You understand the scrutiny we’re under with the UN investigations, so D-Lock is essential for us. They have access to all our lower tier comms. Rest assured this channel is secure, so we can talk freely.

I wanted to offer our services to help with your venture in Yucatan. KDS offers more than just military support to protect our client's physical assets: We also offer high-end data protection.

Considering how delicate the situation is in Mexico, I believe that Kovac is the perfect partner for you. We can keep your competitors out, and keep your confidential data in. Currently, your endeavors are fully exposed. It took me less than half a day to discover the following information:

- The underground facility you are building the Gulf of Mexico is called Garganta.
- Gustavo Peres has recently pressed you for additional funds. He presents a liability that will need to be remedied in the near future.
- A mass grave containing 3500 bodies is located near the town of Chicxulub. No death certificates have been presented for these individuals.
- Construction costs from the most recent audit are approximately $7.3 billion; $2.4 billion more than was declared at the board of directors meeting on June 15th.
- Medical records database and toxicology reports from Garganta indicate the presence of "unknown pathogens". The WHO have not been informed of these findings.

I am telling you this because your secrets are not secure. I am not extorting you or threatening you. I see this as an opportunity for both of us. Your activities can be easily discovered by any agency willing to do the legwork. You need to fix that.

Let me know if you would like to discuss the matter further.

Anders
