Andrew,
It has come to my attention that some SMC employees are using inappropriate terms to describe the NAM-V virus. There are several terms being used, including:

The Garganta Flu
The Stoops
Stoop Throat
The Pits

The use of these terms must immediately stop. Connecting the virus to our facility could lead to Public Relations disaster, and also casts a pejorative light on Santonian and any affiliated organizations. The use of these terms has already reached Mr. Davies, and we both agree that banning the use of these words within the company is of the utmost importance. I have taken steps to ensure that everyone in Project Insight has been sufficiently trained on the correct nomenclature. You must do the same for your SMC employees.

The correct term for the virus is NAM-V. This is a new virus and we are still investigating the causes, origin, and effects. We cannot for sure say if it originated in Garganta, nor can we conclusively state that it has caused the recent surge in suicide attempts, and we certainly cannot risk any employee carrying these false notions to the outside world.

My team continues to work on decoding the virus, and on developing a vaccine. Your team must start controlling the narrative.

Thank you,

Dean Lockwood
