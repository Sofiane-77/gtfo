Mr. Clinton,

I’m forwarding you a report from the Secretario de Seguridad regarding the evacuations in Yucatan. As you can see, the evacuations are moving forward but it will take some time. You will have to be patient. Millions of people live in the region and the area is under intense scrutiny from several government agencies - both internal and external. Having your people there will only confuse matters and potentially jeopardize the goal. FEMA are still providing services to the local authorities in in Merida, and while ultimately they work under the direction of the Mexican government, they are an entity that we do not have full control over.

Once FEMA have completed their work and there are only our people working the problem, we can begin planting the seeds further up the chain. The only way to speed this up is if Mr. Davies has a way to remove FEMA from our territory.

For now, know that the area is being cleared and when the time is right, you will be the first to know. I suggest you prepare the bid documentation now, so the acceptance process is not encumbered by needless bureaucracy. I have no control over that side of things.

Also, thank you for your contact at KDS. I will be calling him soon to see if we can arrange additional help with the evacuation procedure.

Yours in earnest,

Gustavo
