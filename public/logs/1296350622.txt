Hey Mr. Clinton,

6 months is a very long tour. I'm not comfortable asking my workers to do that. If this is unacceptable, then I understand if you also need to terminate my contract. You hired me to run the crews, and I ask that you let me do that. I don't like saying no to you, but there are enough yes-men here already.

Perhaps we could arrange some weekend breaks to the Chicxulub outpost? I guarantee we will see better productivity if we treat them well.

John,

Congratulations on hitting the target. You're ahead of schedule.

All Garganta personnel will be working in 24 week blocks. Traffic in and out of Garganta will be strictly monitored by Kovac security. No off-site travel will be authorized. Let your team know that there will be no exceptions. That's why we pay them well.

If any of your team cannot handle it, we are willing to terminate contracts now. We will implement the new schedule starting September 15th. Failure to request contract termination by then will be deemed as acceptance of the new terms, and new contract papers will be drafted.
