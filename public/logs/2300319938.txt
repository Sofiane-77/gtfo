Hey Gustavo,

JD suggested I reach out to you again with regards to the situation in the Yucatan. If you need to hear from JD himself, I can have him call you. I’m sure he’d be happy to ease your mind if you’re still concerned about our discussions.

To reiterate, the Santonian Mining Company are always ready to lend a hand with any cleanup operations or relief funds that may be needed when disaster strikes. We pride ourselves on being proactive and rapid when responding to such matters, and I hope our donation to several of your personal charity organizations shows we mean business. We have a complete record of these donations and all associated transactions should you need them in the future.

With that said, can you offer any further insight as to when SMC will be able to get to the area? We’re itching to get involved, and though we’re sure you have many people offering aid, none of them have the backing of JD, nor can they offer the kind of financial support that we can offer.

Let me know,

Andrew
