Subject: Operations Lead position

John,

As an Operations Lead you are expected to put the needs of the company first. This may mean severing relationships you have with other staff if that relationship compromises your ability to serve the company in an unbiased and professional manner. If you wish to continue as an Operations Lead at SMC you must be willing to sacrifice some things.

You must be aware that your communications and movements are being monitored at all times, and yet you continue your inappropriate relationship with Artus Chaparon. I am well aware that Artus has intimate knowledge of the Hearsay System, so he knows exactly where to go to avoid surveillance. Looking through your NavData there are several times you and he "disappeared" for several hours. I have worked with Artus personally in the past and while I consider him a skilled engineer and a reliable worker, there is a reason he only has Tier 4 clearance and is still a Systems Engineer after 4 years with the company.

You are not a Compliance Officer. You are not a Pit Boss. You are not a Lab Tech. I expect more from you. You are on the cusp of receiving a Tier 2 security bump, but I will not approve that promotion until you show you have the maturity to understand what is expected of you as an Operations Lead. It's not just about the work you do, it's about the company you keep.

The relationship with Artus ends today or our next discussion will be regarding your demotion.
