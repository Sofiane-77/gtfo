If L37 is where they found that artifact then yes, I am looking into it. I can't tell you any more because you're a 122 and I'm an 85. I'll tell you more if you make it into the 90s. For now, sorry. Need to know basis.

Seriously though, I have heard of pockets around the place where the clocks are off. Maybe something to do with the magnetic field of the earth or something? I don't know. The deeper we go, the more it happens. Maybe something to do with...

THE THINGS!!!!

I'll let you know if I hear about anything else happening. Keep your stick on the ice.

Decker,

The clocks on L37 are running slow. All of them, all by the exact same amount. There's a 230 second deviation every 24 hours. We have the same clocks on L36 and they keep perfect time.

Are you looking into this?

Igor.
