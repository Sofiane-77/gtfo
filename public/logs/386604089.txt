The Iridium price surged to an all-time high of $2868 per troy oz on Friday in the final hours of trading after Zoltran Data Storage announced they will be transitioning all of their hardware over to TurboByte Hard Drives. TurboByte uses Iridium alloy in their 5 Petabyte system, which will become Zoltran's primary storage hardware in all of their data facilities.

In response to the price climb, shares in Santonian Mining Company (SMC) rose by 8.2% in a single day. Santonian are the market leaders in rare mineral and metal farming, and have seen steadily increasing market value in the last decade due to massive infrastructure investment from their parent company, Dreyfus Industries. A stock split is expected to be announced at the end of the fiscal year.

The surge is expected to continue in the next few months as the new 16k broadcast standard comes into effect in North America and Western Europe. IRLED displays that meet the criteria will be hitting the market in the next few months, using tech based on Iridium alloys. Iridium is a firm BUY.
