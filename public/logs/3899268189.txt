This is John Schaeffer. I… I'm recording this so I… 
so if anyone finds me this will… explain… what is that… VOICE? 
I can't stop it… come on… breathe… 
This is John Schaeffer. I… I think, maybe, I am a prisoner? Or maybe… 
I work in this place? I don't know what… I don't remember… 
I think I was unconscious or, or I had an accident? There is… a voice, 
it's telling me, ordering me, demanding… 
"EXTRACT! RETREAT! COMPLY! EXTRACT! RETREAT"… 
Stop it! Stop! It's okay. You can ignore it. I'm not listening. I can't hear it. 
I don't hear you! 
Now… where was I? Remember… I was… with some people… 
QUIET! 
We were… we had weapons! We had weapons and THAT VOICE was giving orders, 
giving us all orders, but then… we were attacked? 
Yes, something attacked us and then EXTRACT! RETREAT! COMPLY! 
I will not! I DO NOT HEAR YOU! 
Where are the others? Did they… I think… I think they're dead. 
They're dead and I… did I escape? Yes, I escaped and now all I hear is 
THAT VOICE. COMPLY! 
My name is John Schaeffer. My name is John Schaeffer. My name is… 
Wait! I'm an… engineer! Not a prisoner! An engineer! 
I will NOT comply. 
I'm John Schaeffer, and I'm an engineer, and now… I'm here. Why? 
Why am I here? 
WHY AM I HERE? 
What did I do? I didn't do anything! 
Stop! What are you! 
Stop the voice… I have to stop the voice. I have to STOP IT—
