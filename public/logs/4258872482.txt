VOICE 1
Interview with Operative 4711… that’s… oh! Hackett. Where are we? 6 months. Good. Okay. Wake him up.

VOICE 2
Ugh…ah shit!

VOICE 1
Are you okay?

VOICE 2
Yeah. Who the fuck are you?

VOICE 1
You’re probably feeling a little confused.

VOICE 2
No. Not at all. Where the fuck am I?

VOICE 1
You don’t remember?

VOICE 2
I just fucking asked you, didn't I?

VOICE 1
Can you give me your name please?

VOICE 2
How about you give me yours?

VOICE 1
Do you know where you are?

VOICE 2
What are these straps for?

VOICE 1
They’re for your safety.

VOICE 2
Oh yeah? Or yours. Aiden Hackett. That’s my name.

VOICE 1
Interesting.

VOICE 2
Why… why can't I remember anything? What is this place?

VOICE 1
This is a clinic. Of sorts.

VOICE 2
What kind of fucking clinic? What happened to me?

VOICE 1
You’re having trouble remembering things. What can you tell me about your father?

VOICE 2
Nothing. I don't know who that is. Now, how about you undo these straps?

VOICE 1
Or your brothers? Cormac, Rory and… Killian. Do those names jog any memories?

VOICE 2
No. Look, you can trust me. Just take off the straps.

VOICE 1
The names don't stimulate any feelings?

VOICE 2
No. No feelings at all. Now look, where the fuck am I?

VOICE 1
You are in a special program that is designed to help with memory loss.

VOICE 2
Oh yeah? Okay. And how did I lose my memories?

VOICE 1
Ah, no. We’re trying to make sure you lose them.

VOICE 2
What? That doesn't make sense. Tell me why the fuck I’m here!

VOICE 1
I’ll explain everything soon enough, Mr. Hackett.

VOICE 2
That is not an answer!

VOICE 1
We’re going to show you some images, and play some sounds for you. Afterwards, we can talk again, see how you feel then. Close it up.

VOICE 2
Hey, no! Don't you fucking close that lid. No! Don't you—

VOICE 1
Let’s give him… 2 of the NGF protein clusters and 1 of the serotonin, then run program Semantic-02 on him.
