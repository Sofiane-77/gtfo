Dean,

Thank you for the correction. I have spoken to coordinator Harriet Lorde and made the necessary arrangements.

If you haven’t been informed, I assume you don’t need to know. I suggest you speak to your superiors if you have questions.

Why are you sending this to me? Contact your area coordinator. Also, what is the Rise Project?

Dean,

The KDS shipment will be arriving this week. This delivery is to be dispatched immediately to our private vault. They are NOT to be delivered to the usual Hydrostasis holding vault. A Kovac representative will meet you at the vault entrance and take things over from there.

These HSUs have been allocated to the Rise Project. They are not to be unpacked or interacted with in any way by anyone other than a Kovac representative with Tier 5 clearance. Please instruct your staff accordingly.

Andre Piros
