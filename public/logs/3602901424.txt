STOKES
So... I figured out a way to... not me, I mean one of my team... Nolan, was it? Nolan figured out a test we could run on the artifacts that might help us understand... I can hear you out there! I told you I don't want to be disturbed! Hello? We initiated a jump through the Matter Wave Projector, but with a different configuration of the Data Blocks. They're navigation blocks. I don't know how we can figure out where they go to without actually going there ourselves, but at least we know. What else? The silicon resin does temporarily block the jump effect, so that has helped. It decays pretty quickly as the Cretasium eats through it, but it means we can actually touch the artifacts at least. I haven't written to Howie in weeks. I know they read our mail and I'm worried I'll say something that pisses off one of those Kovac nazis so... I'm just- I'm just keeping him away from this cancer. This place is hell. I want to go home.
