Dr Stokes,

Here's the second message. I don't know how to explain this. I haven't tried to reach them over comms since the incident.

Nolan Connor

DURANT
We lost Bishop today. Just gone. Alice was scanning quantum frequencies, which she has done diligently every morning for years. She claims she heard something. A voice. She said it was Nolan Connor. I remember him. He was Dr. Stoke's assistant I believe. He ran comms... or telemetry... anyway, Alice is positive she heard his voice, calling for a response from E-F-Zero-One. That was... is... our mission identifier. Alice then asked Bishop to check the datacubes. They've been dead for years but she says she was getting a reading from one of them. So Bishop checked them and... he was gone. I don't know... I don't know if he's dead or... if he made it back or... My god, what are we going to do without him? He convinced the other operatives to help with building the new facility, with the outposts. He was always... stoic, but... I don't know who can replace him. Maybe if he made it back he'll tell them we're still here. Still alive. Alice is hopeful. She is convinced he returned to earth. For now I've ordered everyone to stay away from the datacubes. There are so few of us left. We can't lose anyone else.
