Is it— [recording]? Yes. 
This is John Schaeffer. I removed a… device, surgically attached to… 
I think my brain stem. I don't know how it got there, but I could feel it, 
under the skin. I was hearing… a voice? Not really a voice, a demand, 
a thought, over and over, in my mind. I assumed it was connected to 
the device so I removed it. 
It worked. Now my thoughts are… well, my own. I have to figure out how it 
got there. Something happened to me. In this place. I don't know where I am 
but… there's something familiar. This nightmare is somehow… 
I don't know… expected? Assumed? It's like I was always here, 
but it used to be different. I know things but I don't know how I know them. 
I can operate machinery — well like this recorder — but I don't know how 
I know. That's my first objective. Objective. That word again! My first… 
task, is to figure out where I am, and why I'm here. And who the others are. 
I have seen them, moving through the corridors, opening doors, 
attacking those creatures, communicating with each other, but… 
it's different. Like they are… programmed, maybe? Maybe I am one of them, 
or was? I haven't approached them yet, they seem… violent. Aggressive. 
They're like soldiers but I don't think they are. Maybe mercenaries, or… 
captives to whatever it is that implanted that device on me. Ugh. 
It's still so confusing. 
I think I'm sick. Maybe I got an infection after I ripped out that 
FUCKING device. I feel, heavy. Like my brain is wet. I'm tired. 
It could just be this place. The dark. Those… creatures. 
What the hell are they? 
Come on John. You can figure this out. At least I know my name. 
My name is John Schaeffer.
