This is John Schaeffer. It's been 4 days since I removed the implant. The fog has cleared a little. My memory is... it's coming back, in pieces. I'm in a place called Garganta. I have... glimpses of memories of this place but nothing concrete. I know I am an engineer, and I have a sense that I worked here, which makes sense. I don't know what this place is though. It might be a mine or a research facility, or both. There are areas that look military, or at least very high level security. There are other soldiers... or mercenaries, like I thought I was. They seem to have a purpose, an objective. I remember something... ordering, compelling me. I don't know what they are looking for, but there's hundreds of them; there could be thousands. There's a winch, or an elevator or some kind that drops them to different levels, and then they disappear into the dark on some unknown errand. I tried approaching a group that landed on my level but they shot at me. I got close enough to see they all have implants - so whatever put that device in me has control of them too. I heard some of them mention "the Warden". They see themselves as prisoners, I think. I can't get close enough to talk to them. I have to make contact with them though; we have a common enemy. The creatures. I don't know what those things are or how they got here, but I do know that we're the prey.
I need more information. I have to find a working terminal. If I can find one that still has power, I should be able to figure it out. I mean, I'm an engineer, right?
