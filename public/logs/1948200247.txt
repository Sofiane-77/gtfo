Hearsay on. Kovac Defense Services had a cloning program called Rise. They wanted to mass produce soldiers instead of using recruits, and they were getting pretty close. They managed to produce living specimens, but they were weak and didn't survive. I've been trying to figure out why the Warden has had mercenaries gathering resources and samples from the Rise program, but it wasn't clear... until today. I saw something. Someone. It was a human, approximately. It was standing in the middle of a mass of creatures, and they weren't attacking it. The creatures knew it was there, but... pheromones? Temperature? Some kind of... social or behavioral characteristic? I don't know. Then a quad of mercenaries came through a security door and before the creatures attacked them, this human - clone; I think - reached a hand out to them. Then the creatures attacked the mercenaries, and by the time the chaos was over, the clone was dead and so were two of the mercenaries. The clone clearly didn't want to hurt the mercenaries. It was trying to communicate. It was weak and looked like it was dying, but... If I see another one like it, I'm going to try to talk to it. Him. Yes, him. Hearsay off.
