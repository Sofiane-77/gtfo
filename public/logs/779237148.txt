Dr Stokes,

I have just collated the final post-launch report and I noticed something odd. I'm scratching my head on this one - maybe it makes sense to you?

During the scrub down of the jump site, we discovered a security officer mask jammed under the launch platform. We ran a forensic on it and the DNA came as KSO Bishop - the only operative who returned from EF-01. However, Bishop had all of his equipment when he returned - including his mask. The mask we found was also a different design to Bishop's mask, but at some point, Bishop must have been wearing the mask. It was covered in his DNA.

I followed up with Mr. Piros and explained the conundrum. Mr. Piros informed me that Bishop's equipment is all accounted for. I asked Mr. Piros if they had issued Bishop any new equipment after the expedition, but Mr. Piros told me Bishop is using the same equipment he was issued with when he was delivered to Garganta. Mr. Piros refused to give me any more information at that point and simply stopped responding to me. I don't think he was hiding anything; I think he just had nothing else to say.

So now we have this mask. I don't know if this means anything, but I'm stumped. I have secured the item in the artifact vault should you want us to run any further tests on it.

Let me know,

Nolan Connor
