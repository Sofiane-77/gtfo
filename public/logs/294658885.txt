Mr Davies,

Everything has been arranged. I have personally vetted the security detailed assigned to him. He will be taken directly from the London office to the City airport. I have also stationed people at his residence to report in should he get suspicious. Our connection at the Venezuelan embassy will handle disposing of entry records and visa paperwork. He will be taken directly from the airport to a Valencia safehouse, where they will take his passport and make sure he is tagged with a no-fly marker to make sure he doesn't find a way out.

We expect the city to come under rebel control in the next few weeks. We will need to ensure safe passage for some of our friends to make sure everything goes according to plan. With the rebels closing in I'd like to make those arrangements now. Please let me know if you see any issue with that.

I heard about the promotion. Well deserved. Let me know if you need anything else.

Dean Lockwood.

Dean,

I believe Valencia would be a perfect location for him. Make the arrangements.
