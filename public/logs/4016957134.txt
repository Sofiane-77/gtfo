STOKES
Hearsay on. This is Dr. Stokes. This afternoon we detected a power surge in the Translocation Chamber. We investigated and discovered that the team had returned. Well, at least one of them did. One of the security detail... umm. Bishop, maybe.  Yeah... Bishop, yes. We didn't see the return, but the Matter Wave Projector was on the mounting platform and the KSO was just standing there. He did eventually speak and he wouldn't tell us what happened. I don't know if he didn't remember or he'd been ordered not to tell us, but in the middle of us questioning him, a man named Piros turned up and led him away. Just took him away. I mean it's good that we have the artifact back and we'll scrape together whatever data we can from it, but the only eye witness we have has disappeared into that mysterious Kovac area and no one here seems to have any idea what they do down there. I have so many mixed feelings. Relief that the device has been returned, distraught that we lost people. I'm angry that the information is being deliberately withheld from me, and I'm so fucking confused about what the hell happened last week. I understand so little about the Fossil or these artifacts. My best guess... is that whoever constructed the Fossil found a way to harness the effects of the Matter Wave Projector and maybe... maybe they used it as a propulsion system. Or something. Or… I don't know what I'm doing. I have been here almost a full year and I am no closer to solving this. Much as I found Dr. Hammerstein difficult to work with, I am missing his input right now. I think I may be depressed. And um... a little lost. I am going to schedule some time with Dr. Teale.
