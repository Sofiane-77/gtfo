Hey Art,

Sorry I've been out of touch. Working. I never get to see you now as I'm always deep.

I checked the injured list and didn't see your name on it so I assume you're fine after the blasts. I'm sure you're wondering what happened. Gianna's team found a new natural chamber - only it wasn't natural. Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to look inside it before Insight closed off the area.

They weren't telling me anything, and I was getting frustrated... then I remembered that Hearsay backdoor you told me about, so...

I had a listen to their comms. Sorry. I was careful. It won't come back to you.

I heard Insight sending in a probe to inspect the chamber. They found a few Sleepers then suddenly they lost signal with the probe. A few seconds later, the blast happened. I know you must have felt it. I thought the walls were going to collapse. Everything smelled like burning metal - which I didn't know was a smell until I smelled it.

We have literally no idea what caused the blast, or how it caused such destruction. Whatever it was originated from that chamber, or close to it. It killed a lot of the creatures (and a few of our people). To me, it looked deliberate. It was aimed at the creatures. We're finding dozens of molten passages and there's always a creature corpse nearby (if we find them before they disappear). We lost some people (including Harris if you haven't heard) but I think they were accidental. We weren't the target.

With Harris gone, I need a new pit boss. Interested?

Shafe.

Harriet,

That’s a BIOCOM access key. BIOCOM is a self-governing DI entity. I don’t run it. No one “runs” it. If it needs more power, it tries to get it. Other than that I have no idea why it made this request. If you have any more questions, run them by a flagged supervisor first. I'm busy keeping you alive.

Andre

Mr. Piros,

I have been alerted to multiple attempts to access Garganta’s power control system. This system is, as far as I know, entirely off-limits to KDS and yet, as you can see below - you are attempting to reroute power to unit B-7 (that's KDS Deep) for some reason. Had the system approved the request, the grid would have overloaded and almost every subsystem in the entire facility would have shut down.

Care to explain?
