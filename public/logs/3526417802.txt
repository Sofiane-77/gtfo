State of Truth. Truth. I don't know how much... how much longer I can do this. They have taken... so much. I cannot rid myself of these demons. My hand has been forced. My soul has been stained. These insidious, malevolent... savages, will stop at nothing to inject their venom into us. They feed on me, on what's left of my humanity. Everything they touch is debased and violated. They poison the waters, they burn the crops, they subvert all that is good and... and... they turn those we love against us... They left me with no choice. No choice. The evidence was there. Once I saw through their veil of lies I knew had to act. They took her from me, destroyed anything that was left of her long ago. They took the one thing I loved and sent back a facsimile. A copy. A blighted, ugly version of the person I knew. It was... mercy. It was mercy... I am alone. Are you out there? Is anyone out there? Because there's no one left in here. God forgive me.
