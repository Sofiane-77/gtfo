Ms. Klein,

I recommend only using Tau gen until we have fully investigated the issue with Sigma gen. The Pretoria lab is running some tests on our Genesis Operatives and our remaining Sigmas to isolate the behaviors you mentioned. A few questions:

Can you send photos of the self-harm you indicated with operative 2056? We need to confirm if the scarring is indiscriminate or definitely religious. Our records show this operative has exhibited similar behavior before, despite multiple resets.

The head banging behavior has not been noted in any other GOs and may indicate either a neural aberration or vestigial behavior trait that escaped the reprogramming. Does it start immediately after resuscitation, or after some period of time? I would like video evidence for the records and a more detailed report please. I don't want to mark an operative as Faulty without due diligence.

Can you send me a list of any other operatives you marked as Faulty and sent to recycling? We track both organ and tissue stocks here so we can trace the history should we need it.
