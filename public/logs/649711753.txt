There you are.

VOICE 2
Who are you? I can't move!

VOICE 1
You must remain calm.

VOICE 2
Why am I… I don't… What's going on? I don't… I don't remember—

VOICE 1
You don't remember?

VOICE 2
No… what is this? Why can't I move my arms?

VOICE 1
It's for your own protection. You are perfectly safe.

VOICE 2
Safe? I don't feel fucking safe! What's in my neck? It hurts!

VOICE 1
It's helping you, Bishop. That is your name, isn't it?

You've been asleep a long time.

Asleep? Like… like a… a coma?

You were in hydrostasis.

Hydrostasis? Oh no… fuck you! Get me… get me out of here right now!

No you fucking won't! I know what… what you do… oh god…

You should be proud. You are one of the Genesis generation! Very special indeed.
