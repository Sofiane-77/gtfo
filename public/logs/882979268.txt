Dr Hammerstein,

The creatures we found clearly have traces of human DNA, and it is short sighted of you to dismiss the possibility that they might have once been Garganta staff. Their DNA is not "similar" to human, it is human, at least in part. The fact that their corpses do not dematerialize may indicate that these specimens are a different variant from the others, or that the physiology of the "Gallus" genus is eclectic depending on the environment in which they develop.

I have presented the evidence for RNA editing to you twice now, and both times you have dismissed my research with disdain. It is entirely feasible that an extraterrestrial lifeform could have evolved to exploit such a trait - cephalopods have achieved it on earth. Embracing research into RNA editing may unlock  a path to returning these creatures to their genetic structure pre-mutation, and if they are indeed former humans, it is our duty to explore that possibility. The creatures also have an enormous viral load, making it even more imperative that we research if at least some of the creatures are a product of end stage of NAM-V. I don't believe you can wrap up this virus or the creatures into a neat package and force them all into a box labeled "Gallus".

As we go deeper we are finding more and more of these creatures [maybe we should call them Gallus Stokus] which indicates that the environment plays a role in the genetic modification. Perhaps there is something at the lower depths that drives the mutation? Considering the bizarre artifacts we have already found we cannot close the door to any possibilities. I don't have the answers, but without an openness to radical thought we never WILL have the answers.

You are a complete
