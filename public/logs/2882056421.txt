Hearsay on.
[2.3 second silence]

Okay, so, I just checked the quantum signature from E-F-Zero-One. Now we only got a 5 millisecond data burst, but it gave us something to work with at least. The frequency rate of the tether during those 5 milliseconds is different to the frequency rate of the tether in the moments before we initiated the jump.
[3.1 second silence]
STOKES
The frequency is different. The frequency is different!

I mean, assuming this data is correct - and even if our equipment were damaged in some way it wouldn't give us false readings, it would give us nothing - but assuming it is correct that means that wherever Dr Durant and his team ended up, their clocks would be running faster.
[2.6 second silence]
STOKES
It's not a relativity issue. This is a calculable change in the quantum frequency. Durant's time was running faster than our time. And not by a little - by a lot. Back of the envelope math is1 second in our quantum frequency is about 85 seconds in Durant's quantum frequency. I mean I

I want to scream but I don't have the energy. There are places that pass through time at a different rate. This is multi-dimensional physics. This is a change in our fundamental understanding of the universe, or it's another universe, or there are multiple versions of this universe and we happened to pick up the trace of a different universe or

This is too big for me. I don't know who to talk to. If I go to Hammerstein he'll take over and want the credit. I don't care if he gets it but he'll slow the process down trying to curate it to his gain. If I tell Howie then they'll see my email and everyone will know and I'll lose control. I mean they are listening to everything so
[2.8 second silence]
STOKES
Hearsay off.
