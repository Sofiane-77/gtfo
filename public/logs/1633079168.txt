D017
You're not listening to me. I am getting no response at all, not a bounce back. The message is getting there nothing is coming back, so it.

RESPONSE COORDINATOR
What you're reporting sounds like a BIOCOM network issue.

D017
Right, so is the network down on your end.

RESPONSE COORDINATOR
BIOCOM doesn't have network issues. Have you logged out and back in.

D017
I tried that. I tried everything at my tier. Blast doors, media [inaudible], temperature con.

RESPONSE COORDINATOR
Did you say media server.

D017
Yes, temperature control... I can't even turn on the fucking lights.

RESPONSE COORDINATOR
Have you tried accessing BIOCOM from a different terminal. You may need to ascend.

D01
How the fuck do I do that when there is no elevator. I have no power. Fuck are you even listening to me. I am trapped down.

RESPONSE COORDINATOR
I don't see what that has to do with BIOCOM

D017
You know as well as I do there is only one thing that can override every system in the place and that's [biocom], but I can't find any controllers down.

RESPONSE COORDINATOR
If you're locked out, it's because you're supposed to be locked out. BIOCOM doesn't make mistakes, sir.

D017
So it's not even possible it could go wrong. I am the one who is stuck here you fucking asshole. Oh no.

RESPONSE COORDINATOR
You don't need to speak to me like that. Okay, I'm logging off.

D017
Oh jesus christ, no. What the hell is that. Please come and get me. Please, I am begging you.

RESPONSE COORDINATOR
You need to trust the protocol. If BIOCOM has locked you out you just need to wait until.

D017
Oh no, please, you fucking assholes.

RESPONSE COORDINATOR
If BIOCOM has locked you out you need to wait until it sends a KSO quad to extract you. We have to follow protocol.

D017
[inaudible]

RESPONSE COORDINATOR
I can't understand you.

D017
[inaudible]

RESPONSE COORDINATOR
Okay. I don't have to listen to that. I'm logging off. Good luck.
