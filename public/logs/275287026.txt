TEALE
Mia?

MIA
What?

TEALE
I'm Dr. Teale.

MIA
I've already seen the doctor. I just need... 
God! I just need a cream or something for the itching!

TEALE
They're getting you something now. You told the doctor you saw something. A bug, maybe?

MIA
Yes. I don't know, maybe-- 
You're Dr. Teale.

TEALE
Yes.

MIA
I don't need a shrink.

TEALE
I am a psychotherapist, yes, but I speak to everyone here, Mia.

MIA
Do you think I'm making this up?

TEALE
No, I—

MIA
I know what people say about this place but I did not imagine this. Look at my head! It's raw! 
Fuck, I just need something to—

TEALE
Mia stop. You're bleeding—

MIA
I know I'm bleeding! That's why I need... 
You know what? I don't need to speak to you. It's— I just need something to get rid of this thing.

TEALE
Thing? Do you mean the bug you saw?

MIA
Yes, but I didn't... I woke up and felt something crawling on my head so I went to the bathroom, but when I turned on the light 
it... it disappeared.

TEALE
Disappeared? Did you actually see the bug?

MIA
Yes! Maybe. I don't know! I think... I think it might have burrowed... into the skin

TEALE
Into your skin?

MIA
Yes! Can you... will you look?

TEALE
I'm not a medical doctor—

MIA
Give me your hand—

TEALE
Mia, let go of me—

MIA
Feel it!

TEALE
No! (sounds of a struggle)

TEALE
Mia, stop! You're hurting me!

MIA
It's in there! Do you feel it? (sounds of a violent struggle)

TEALE
Please-- Ow! (shouting) Dr. Banks!

MIA
It's in all of us. (unidentifiable sounds)

TEALE
Oh god... Let me GO!

TEALE
Dr. Banks?! DR. BANKS!
