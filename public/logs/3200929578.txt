Mr. Lockwood,

The asset you requested has been located. He has been working with Médecins Sans Frontières under an assumed name. I'm guessing they didn't do much of a background check.

He protested of course, but I suggested he work with us and he accepted. He understands he is either with us, or we’ll expose him. Interpol still has an active Red Notice on him after the Cornerstone Trials, so he seems relieved that he can stop running. He had several questions about Insight, so despite his protestations, he’s in.

I have updated and attached his file. Let me know if you need anything else,

Rutger
