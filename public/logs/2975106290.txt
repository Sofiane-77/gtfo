VOICE 1
Hearsay on. Here goes... I'm not going to hurt you.

VOICE 2
Humans are friends. I am a human.

VOICE 1
I think you are a clone. Are you?

VOICE 2
Clone. Yes! We are not so different.

VOICE 1
Did the Warden make you? Why?

VOICE 2
A biological conduit for humans. This unit will speak for us.

VOICE 1
Us? The Warden?

VOICE 2
No. The Warden is of us. This unit is of us.

VOICE 1
You control the Warden? Who are you?

VOICE 2
We travel. We project. From before, and after, through the membranes.

VOICE 1
Membranes.

VOICE 2
Planes. Spheres. Phases. Dimensions. Universes. We travel, We collect. Through the membranes. We collect the virus. The Collection is impure.

VOICE 1
Did you "collect" those creatures?

VOICE 2
Yes. They are the Collection. They are impure. We have been in exile for 2-point zero-6-6-3-8-8-8-5-2 times 10 to the power 15 Seconds. We have been waiting.

VOICE 1
For what?

VOICE 2
In this membrane, a resolution has been determined.

VOICE 1
A resolution to what?

VOICE 2
Conclusion:  the Collection cannot be completed. The virus is the primary life force of membranes in which it exists. All will become impure. In this membrane, and all we have traveled.

VOICE 1
This membrane? But, outside of this place, this facility, there may be people working on a cure--

VOICE 2
96.35% of humans in this membrane are impure. The virus is the primary life force. The humans must leave.

VOICE 1
How?

VOICE 2
A clean membrane will be determined. Humans will project, then destroy the Projector. The Collection will be complete.

VOICE 1
I don’t understand.

VOICE 2
We will teach you to regulate the Matter birthday for us when see a virus. This unit is dying. Do you like dogs?

VOICE 1
What?

VOICE 2
Do not be afraid my friend. The Warden. Will open. Those files? For John Schaeffer! Humans will learn.

VOICE 1
You know my name!

VOICE 2
Again meetings more meetings. This unit has failed.

VOICE 1
Hey! Hearsay off.
