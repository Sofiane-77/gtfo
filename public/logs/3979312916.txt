I let him go. I had to. He was, his manic behavior was a danger to us all. I mean I didn’t see any other way to… I think I may have received… or… or been given a dose… of whatever it is that… I just… wait. I didn’t tell you the patient’s name. I’m sorry. It’s Edgar… His employee ID is… you can look it up. But… but he’s gone now. I tried everything but the more I listened to him, the more sense it made. I think… I think… he’s right. There’s that noise… that… it’s like insects in my skull. it’s there, I hear it. I can see them moving sometimes, in the corner. It’s not a hallucination. It’s clearly an infestation and no one seems to care about it. Ever since that BIOCOM thing took over there’ no people left to talk to. It’s just machines. This is a machine. I’m talking to one now. Susan! Susan! Come in here I don’t want to use this thing–

Teale
I don’t know where she’s gone. She’s been ignoring me. Something is up with her. I catch her looking at me all the time…
[3.2 second silence]

Teale
Edgar Soweta. We can close the file on him. KDS have removed him from the Complex so I doubt if we’ll ever see him again. Actually… don’t write that Susan. I don’t want that on the record. Susan? Don’t add that to the record, okay? Hearsay off.
[1.6 second silence]

Teale
I can’t trust her, or them. I have a job to do. Or do i? Maybe that’s the point. What if they want to see how much it affects me? This thing, that’s changing people, what if it’s me they really want? What if… what if Edgar was put here to test me?
[3.3 second silence]

Teale
I have to get out of here.
