Health Dept. Recommends Lock Down
by Sherry Ladella

After the recent outbreak of the so-called the "Florida Flu" in Maricopa, the county health department is encouraging citizens to use "social distancing" to prevent transmission of the outbreak. Little is known about the virus, but the rapid increase in confirmed cases in the last few days is staggering. Governor Dresden has been briefed by the Maricopa Health Department, and is expected to reach a decision by the end of the week. Sources tell us that a full social and commercial lock down has been advised.

The virus first appeared in Maricopa after several tour parties returned from the Miami Beach new year celebrations. Several students and faculty from Arizona State were the first to come down with the virus, and despite efforts to contain the outbreak (including closing down ASU for 2 full weeks), the Florida Flu has spread to multiple communities in and around Phoenix.

Do I have it?
Without any official word from either the county, or from the health department, many people are rightfully angry that they have not been informed on how to recognize the virus, nor how to care for the infected. The Register is taking the unprecedented action of listing reported symptoms here. If you or anyone you know exhibits several of these symptoms, it is recommended you contact your health care provider immediately:

Whitening of the skin
Inflammation of the cheeks, neck, lips and extremities (fingers, toes)
Spinal pain or shocks
Susceptibility to bruising or broken bones
Accelerated breathing/panting
Blood in the sputum

Treatment for the virus is unknown, although a detailed report is expected from the state government in the next few days.

Until then, the Register advises you stay indoors, stock that fridge, and start streaming.
