Please inform Mr. Johanson that there are several other installations planned for that area. It is not just for Kovac's pet projects. If you would like to complain, I suggest you discuss the matter with Dean Lockwood, as he is the one who is holding up the work. He has designated an area right next to the one you are getting for a new project called "Insight". Once the plans for that area are finalized, work will commence - and not before.

I answer to Mr. Lockwood, not you. Feel free to speak directly to him, or to your boss.

Ms. Lorde,

Mr. Clinton has informed me that I should speak to you regarding the schedule for KDS Deep. As I understand it, work is not due to start until March. The assignment was approved on the 7th October last year, so what is the delay in getting the excavation started? It is essential we move our equipment from the temporary hangars. BIOCOM and our other equipment are sensitive to both temperature and pressure. They require precisely controlled environmental conditions to function at maximum efficiency. The hangars do not offer that environment, nor do they offer enough space for our needs.

We need to be moving into our new residence by the end of 2052. Work needs to start on the assignment immediately.

I am confident this misunderstanding will be rectified, so I will arrange the move into our permanent residence for January 1st, 2053.

If you have further questions, please speak to my associate Mr. Piros A134, or to your boss.

Anders Johanson A029
