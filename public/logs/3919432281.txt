This is Matthew Aaron, operations lead for the Daylight Mission. 
I am recording this message at… 11:37am, April 28th, 2057. 
We have reached the port of Progreso and established an operations base 
in the cruise terminal. Unsurprisingly, this place has been abandoned. 
There's no one here — no one in the city at all, as far as we know. 
Getting here was a nightmare. The US government, what's left of it, offered 
no help. We were stuck in Tampa for two weeks until someone in the Cuban 
government heard our broadcast and offered help. They have kindly provided 
transportation, and a military force to protect us. Of course, we took them 
up on their offer. If getting through Florida is any indication of what's 
to come, we are going to need all the help we can get. They picked us up in 
Fort Myers last week. Imagine that. The Cuban Navy land on US soil and 
no one cares. 
We got to Pregreso 2 days ago, and have already managed to lose Dr. Wilkins. 
I'm not sure what happened, he must have just wandered off. We have a squad 
out looking for him. 
Since landing our military escort has reported sightings of… well 
the soldiers are calling them "chichiricu", but I don't know what they are. 
According to Captain Puente they are coordinated and highly aggressive. 
I have asked the soldiers to capture one but they tell me the creatures 
disappear before their corpses can be recovered. Not disappear… vanish, 
maybe? It's probably a translation issue. Regardless, I have yet to see 
one and… well, the local fauna is not our mission. Our mission is NAM-V. 
The viral load present in the corpses from the city is massive. The virus 
has been here a long time. We've also found several mass cremation sites 
that we think haven't been touched in maybe 8 to 10 years, so I believe we 
are on the right track for finding the origin of this virus. We will be 
taking the boats to Garganta tomorrow. I don't know what we're going to 
find there, but I'm… hopeful. I will report again once we get there.
