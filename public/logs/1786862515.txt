Hearsay on.
Okay, update. I had to go down a long way, but I located a terminal that had power, and an open port connected to the network processing center. I created login credentials for myself and replicated them across the network. Now, no matter where I go, if there's a working terminal I can have limited control over local systems like doors, lighting, and the thing I'm recording on now. Hearsay. My clearance level is low though - I've been booted from the network several times by a sentry program called Biocom. It has authority over everything connected to the network, which is, well, everything. Environment controls, air locks, bioscan doors, power distribution, some stuff I don't know about like KDS Deep and Project Rise... whatever they are this BIOCOM program seems to have governing authority at the highest level and can revoke authorization for anything on the network. The problem is, it's not really in control anymore. There's another program that has hijacked Biocom and is using it to control things. This program is called w-r-d-n... Warden. Warden has control of this place, and took control, or always had control, of the mercenaries. The AI entity that is supposed to be running things, Biocom, has been compromised. I don't know why though. What is the purpose of the Warden program? Who put it there? If it's a trojan or a virus, there must be a reason. It seems to be giving orders to the mercenaries, so it must have a purpose.
I still don't how I got here, or why. No new memories. Nothing clear, anyway. Something is telling me, urging me, to go deeper, though. A feeling. I may as well. It's hell no matter which way you go. Maybe I'll find something at the bottom.
