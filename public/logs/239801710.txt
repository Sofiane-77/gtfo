## Abstract
This is the weekly report of Dr. Gallus Hammerstein, founder of Project Insight. I have been feeling under the weather. I have of course pushed through this and continued my exploration of the unknown, but it has been challenging. It is clear that many of my "comrades" are eager for an opportunity to take control of Project Insight, but none of them would dare directly challenge me - even in my weakened state. My underlings are sheep in wolf's clothing. They see themselves as capable leaders and yet their flaws are obvious and exploitable. Let them pine for my power. Non ducor, duco.

## Weekly Achievements
Despite my failing health, I have made some conceptual breakthroughs this week. Genome analysis of the creatures indicates many of them share no common ancestors at all. There are similarities between the genetic structure of the creatures, but their evolutionary paths are entirely unique. They are not branches; they are trees. This leads me to believe these creatures come from many different places. Has Gallus Hammerstein discovered not just life from other planets, but finally answered the question beyond the question? Not only is there life elsewhere, there is life everywhere? I think so, yes. My work speaks for itself.

The common factor between these creatures is the mutations, which are certainly caused by some process introduced by the parasite. The same mutations occur in compromised humans. Strangely the complexity and strength of the mutations increases the deeper we explore. We are even finding infested humans in some of the deep, unexplored chambers. It is as if they are drawn to something. Grubs to their queen perhaps?

## Goals
I need to complete the process of naming the parasites. I have instructed by staff to temporarily call them the Parasitidae Hammerstein, but I'm not sure if I like it yet.

Book title! Enough procrastinating.

Remove those clearly attempting to undermine me and upset the balance of power. I have been ignoring their snide remarks and sideways glances for too long. Next week, the culling begins. God have mercy on those that cross Gallus Hammerstein!

Get well.
