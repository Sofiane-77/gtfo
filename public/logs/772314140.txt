Subject: Bid accepted

Andrew,

I can confirm that the bid will be accepted in the next few weeks. You will have full access up to 15 km off the coast as promised. I will send you the latest survey maps later today.

I want to reiterate that you must not speak to any other government agency about this arrangement. This is a sensitive issue, particularly when it comes to the Department of the Environment and Natural Resources. I have secured this contract so quickly by avoiding the red tape usually required to acquire such an exclusive mining permit. Involving other parties will needlessly complicate things.

Thank you for the donation. My wife will love it!

Gustavo
