Subject: Our culture

Ronnie,

I have authorized the changes you requested, and three sectors have been allocated as triage centers for any employees showing signs of exposure. Isolation of the subjects is essential. With these resources now available to you, I expect more detailed analysis of the subjects in the future. We need to know what is causing the physical abnormalities. Is the spinal deformation permanent, and can the subjects continue to work?

You also need to address the negative culture that is developing out of this. I have heard the term "stoopers" used to describe the subjects. This cannot continue. It incites fear and opposition. Address your teams, Ronnie. This term is no longer acceptable in the Project Insight lexicon. You also need to stamp out use of the word “parasite” for any staff below tier 5.

To prevent any further dissent, I suggest you remove any personnel showing signs of insubordination. Your Kovac handler has been informed of the situation and is available to deal with any troublemakers.

You have my full support, as long as the work continues.

Dean Lockwood
