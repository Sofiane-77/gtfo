# The Hammerstein Collection

## Abstract
This is the weekly report of Dr. Gallus Hammerstein, lead researcher and founder (or co-founder according to some) of Project Insight. I have decided to stop using the Hearsay system to record my daily and weekly notes as I believe prying eyes may wish to take my research and use it for their own gain. As such, I will be keeping all of my files local in a markdown vault so that I have complete control over the information I am gathering. This is clearly the wisest solution given the competitive nature of the staff I have hired for Insight.

## Weekly Achievements
This week we received a new shipment of specimen display cases and formaldehyde. To their credit, Dreyfus have been more than helpful in making sure my project is sufficiently funded and supported for the last 2 years. I'm glad they recognize the importance of my work.

I have started a photographic record of the specimens. At some point in the future I will be getting published for these breakthrough discoveries and will need imagery for the inevitable book and tour lectures.

This week I drew the conclusion that the lifeforms we have been finding do not appear to come from the same evolutionary tree. Indeed, many of them appear to have at least partially evolved in drastically different environments, though there is clearly a commonality in the mutations they all share. There is no indication that the artifacts and objects we have found within the fossil were designed for use by any of the creatures, so quite how they ended up there is still a mystery. The bizarre disappearance of the equipment while working on Artifact 13 suggests some method of transformation or even transportation beyond our current understanding. As such, the origin of these creatures remains a mystery - but they come from different places. Different planets? Universes? I am confident I will unravel the mystery, but my impatience for understanding is overwhelming!

## Goals
I want to display my specimens in as many places as possible to inspire my team to new discoveries. The Hammerstein Collection is destined to be one of the scientific wonders of the world and I feel it is my duty to reward my staff by showing off the work they do to their peers. It is inspirational and I will allow forgive myself for this brief display of pride.

I will be conducting a behavioral analysis of the few living creatures we have managed to capture. They have an extreme sensitivity to aural stimulation, so I will be setting up an experiment to project a range of frequencies throughout the lower levels of Garganta to see which ones draw the most attention. Obviously, this will be a controlled experiment. We will have Security Officers there to protect the researchers as they capture as many varieties of creature as possible. In an ideal world, I would need to order more display cases!

It should be perfectly safe if everyone does as I say. Next week will be monumental for Project Insight!
