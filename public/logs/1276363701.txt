Hearsay On. I barely sleep. When I do it is restless, turbulent, and always, nightmares. My hopelessness exhausts me. The shame consumes my waking hours. I can no longer convince myself that my work is justified. The lives I have sacrificed for an idea that has long since been forgotten. Here, we all forget. A small mercy I have not earned. The world must know about Santonian, about Project Insight. The suffering we inflict on these creatures is unconscionable. Whatever they are, they already exist in perpetual torment without the violence we perpetrate upon them. Who are we to deny life to any creature we deem to be less human than our barbaric selves? This is the eleventh plague. Nothing will spare us from our destiny. We are the dead. This self-pity disgusts me. I have letters to write. I must end this insanity. Hearsay off.
