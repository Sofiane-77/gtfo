Andrew,

I see the "value" of the Hearsay system and considering the price of Iridium, I understand the need for tightened security, but the way it is being done is simply wrong. Have you talked to the staff or checked in on the social meetings lately? The mess hall? They are all empty. Everyone is so terrified that something they say is going to be picked up by a microphone or that one of their colleagues is actually a Kovac spy that they’re just not talking anymore. Everyone just checks in for work, does their shift, then locks themselves away in their cabins. My grandfather told me about this shit when he was a boy and you know how that worked out. There's something very wrong here Andrew. Spying on your people and bringing in these concrete head thugs to keep the law is not acceptable. And the pompous assholes from Project Insight sneer down their nose at the people who actually built this place for them. We need a worker's charter or something to make sure we are all being taken care of, not just Davies pets!

I know I'm just a lowly engineer and you don't have time for your friends anymore, but shit, this is out of control. Do something!

Igor
