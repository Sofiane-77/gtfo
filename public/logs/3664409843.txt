Subject: Sec-B-M Chip 2.7.4 has been shipped

Ms. Klein,

The new Sec-B-M chips have been sent out. The first shipment will contain 120,000 chips ready for installation. These chips will allow you to increase the PRDM upload speed to 1300MB/s without any risk of overloading the subject.

I have forwarded the installation instructions to your cybernetics team, though it's much the same as all the 2.7's. There may be a slight protuberance once implanted as the chips use the new integrated 3d structure, making them slightly thicker. We have reinforced the shell to account for the reduced sub-dermal depth. The new chips are more vulnerable to magnetism, so they'll need to be checked if the subject is exposed to any field in excess of 25,000g.

Please be careful with over pasting. Dots not crosses.
