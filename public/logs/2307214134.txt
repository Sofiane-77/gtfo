Subject: Hearsay Installation schematics

Artus,

Attached are the schematics and installation locations for the Hearsay system. Make sure there is enough room in the communication conduits on each level to install the necessary cables (refer to the schematic for details).

The Hearsay schematic and attached papers are for tier 4 clearance only. This is 2 tiers above your current clearance level. I expect you to handle this with the utmost caution and discretion. Do not discuss the work or the Hearsay system with anyone on your team. If anyone asks you why you are widening the comms conduits, report them to a tier 4 security advisor immediately.

Do not mention Hearsay, its installation locations, or its purpose to anyone. You are not aware of the Hearsay system, or its purpose. It is a classified SMC security system, and therefore never to be discussed by anyone below tier 4.

I am giving you this information because I see potential in you, Artus. Do not let me down.

Andrew Clinton
