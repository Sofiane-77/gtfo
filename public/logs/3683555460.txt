James,

I can't. I have so much research to do here already. I've been working for 4 years to get a result and I finally have something. I can't just drop my life's work to be by your side. You didn't even mention my news :(

I'm sorry. Just go and have fun. Bring back as many specimens as you can. I'll have a new hydroponics lab prepared for your return.

You're a good friend James. Get home safely.

Susan

I have to stay here until the mission. I'm so bored.

I would really like you to put your name in for EF01. It's not too late. Please don't make me go with Alice. Apart from the fact that we may discover species never seen before, an environment we've never seen before, a place - who knows? Apart from the fact that we will go down in history as pioneers of this new frontier, I don't want to experience this without you.

Please come.

James

I know you're busy preparing for the expedition, but I had to tell someone!

The protein sequencer WORKS. Honestly, I thought it was HeliForm bluster as usual but we used it on the Gramineae using the funghi algorythm and oh my god it WORKED. I'm still anaylzing the new genetic structure to see what it did exactly, but the grasses are growing faster that ever before, and with less light. I have Geordie planting a whole new batch that will experience only 4 hours of AL and I'm confident they will grow just fine. Then we can move on to more complex plants, fruits, vegetables, ttrees, who knows. This is it! This is what I've been waiting for. I'm so BLAAAARGH!!!!

When will they let you out of isolation so I can show you?
