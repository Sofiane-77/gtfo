Subject: Mandatory psych evaluations

It has come to my attention that many employees have not been attending their mandated psychiatric evaluations. May I remind you that these are not optional, which is why we have specifically used the word mandatory:

MANDATORY
măn′də-tôr″ē

1) adjective

- Required or commanded by authority; obligatory.
- Of, having the nature of, or containing a mandate.
- Holding a League of Nations mandate over a territory.

Please contact one of my medical staff if you require further assistance to understand your obligation. These evaluations are for your benefit.
