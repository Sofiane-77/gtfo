VOICE 1
God told you to kill those men?

VOICE 2
No. I mean… is that easier for you to understand? To blame it on God? No, I killed them. I killed them.

VOICE 1
Why?

VOICE 2
They were evil. Corrupt. They had strayed from the path. I brought order to their chaos.

VOICE 1
Those marines, at Larnaca… Was that chaos? From where we stand it appears as if you brought chaos to this world, not your victims.

VOICE 2
No! I was stopping the chaos. We are in hell, brother. There are no victims here. We have all been shown the path and given a choice. They chose to stray from the path. They made their choice. I did my duty. I had to do it. This is war!

VOICE 1
And those marines were the enemy?

VOICE 2
Yes! Or… Listen, I knew every one of them. Apostles of the devil, to a man. They celebrated it, rejoiced in the chaos of their deeds. I did give them a last chance to hear the word before their judgment, but they chose to remain deaf.

VOICE 1
Did they laugh at you?

VOICE 2
They did not seek forgiveness. That is what matters.

VOICE 1
Let’s talk about Turkey. Your "Miracle Mile" as they call it--

VOICE 2
That was not a miracle. It was a message. When Erzurum fell to the rebels, he spared me. When I spent 26 days behind enemy lines, he led me. When I crossed the DMZ with the crosshairs of the sniper upon me, he shielded me. When I walked blind through the minefield, he gave me his vision. That is a message. I heard it loud and clear, as he wanted. It was personal. I must do my duty, so I did.

VOICE 1
This duty may end with you going to the chair.

VOICE 2
You cannot kill me. It is not in his plan.

VOICE 1
We’re going to send you somewhere to get some help.

VOICE 2
I know.

VOICE 1
It’s a new program, designed for people just like you, Woods.

VOICE 2
I know. I knew before you did. I am going where he needs me. I will be ready. When the plague comes, I shall be rescued from the lion's mouth, and he will lead us from the darkness. For though there may be many of me, he is one.

VOICE 1
Well, we’ll see won’t we?

VOICE 2
I will see. You will die.
