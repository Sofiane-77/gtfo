Teale

Good morning Edgar.

Teale

Not talking today?

Teale

I spoke to the pharmacy.

E105

[inaudible]

Teale

You haven’t collected your prescription.

E105

[inaudible]

Teale

You’ll need to speak up Edgar.

E105

I don’t want pills.

Teale

Why not?

E105

Too foggy.

Teale

We can lower the dose.

Teale

It’s important that you take the pills Edgar. These… hallucinations--

E105

They’re not hallucinations.

Teale

Forgive me. These… visions cause you a lot of distress.

E105

No pills.

Teale

Edgar--

E105

No pills.

Teale

If you are unwilling to help yourself, I can’t in good conscience allow you to return to the mine.

E105

Okay.

Teale

You don’t want to work?

E105

I’m not taking any more pills.

Teale

Very well. I’ll let operations know that you’re on medical leave until further notice. I don’t think we should wait until next week for your next session. Stop by tomorrow, okay?

Teale

HearSay off.
