Andrew,

I see the "value" of the Hearsay system and considering the price of Iridium, I understand the need for tightened security, but the way it is being done is plain wrong. Have you talked to your staff lately? Checked in on the social meetings? THEY ARE ALL EMPTY. Everyone's terrified of even talking to each other! My grandfather told me about this shit when he was a boy and you know how that worked out. There's something very wrong here Andrew. Spying on your people and bringing in these concrete head THUGS to keep the law is not acceptable. And the pompous assholes from Project Insight sneer down their nose at the people who actually BUILT this place for them. We need a worker's charter or something to make sure we are ALL being taken care of, not just Davies pets!

I know I'm just a lowly engineer and you don't have time for your friend anymore, but shit, this is out of control. Do something!

Igor
