CONNOR
Hearsay on. It’s one year since Dr. Stokes left us. I still have no idea what happened to her. The record says she was removed due to schizophrenic psychotic episodes I think, but I don’t know where she went. There's no indication of what treatment she received or where she ended up. I've tried reaching out to Howard, but I'm pretty sure they are blocking our external communications. They won't tell us what's going on outside, but from what I can gather it's bad out there. I miss her. She was brilliant, brilliant, and her energy was much needed after Hammerstein's toxicity. She was a breath of fresh air. Until she wasn't. In the end she went the same way we all do. Paranoid, temperamental, depressed. And I'm next. I've avoided contact with the creatures as much as I can. I rarely venture into the inner if I can help it. I've remained as isolated as possible, and I don't have the virus yet which is... unexpected. There are a few of us who have avoided infection, and we've all followed the same pattern. Bare minimum of contact with any other staff. Full protective gear outside of our quarters. Regular hydrostasis immersion - which definitely helps, regardless of what the official stance may be. I haven't removed my gel-mask in 2 years, other than changing the filters. I do feel like it's starting to affect me though. They say a few hours at a time will have no impact on short term memory, but it's cumulative, so. Given the alternative, I'll take the risk. Oh, we have a meeting with the board members from Dreyfus, Santonian and Kovac tomorrow - what's left of them - they want to know why we haven't had any breakthroughs. So easy to demand answers when you're sitting in a bunker in the middle of god knows where. Down here, it isn't so easy. We… we all get it. We may be the last chance there is. Hearsay off.
