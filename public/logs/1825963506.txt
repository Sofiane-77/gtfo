MATTHEW AARON
This is Matthew Aaron, operations lead for the Daylight Mission. It's... June 12th, 2057. We've found him. Patient Zero. We've got him! Or a record of him, at least. NAM-V originated here, and now we have the proof. He was an employee of the Santonian Mining Company, he was 33 at the time he contracted the virus. He fled Garganta on... shit where is it... on 28th December 2052. Santonian were tracking him, well, Kovac were, and they believe he may have made it as far as Florida, which is where the CDC issued its first alert on January 11th 2053. This has to be him! It has to be. And they knew it all along! My god. They knew it all along. We found an internal email saying as much. Santonian knew about the virus and said nothing. Then they let it escape. It's not clear how the patient caught the virus. We don't have the medical records yet. He was working on something called Project Insight. We're still working on getting into that database. The network segmentation limits access to particular terminals. I think we're going to have to bite the bullet and go deeper into the facility. We've only made it down about 300 meters and... well none of us want to go any deeper. The mind plays tricks on you down there. I'm sure there's no one left alive here but I keep hearing things. The echoing and reverb is so distorted it's easy to get paranoid. You think someone is following you only to turn around and realize it's your own footsteps. Listen. Hello! Yeah. Matthew Aaron out.
