Mr. Hamsun,

Security footage shows the target left the facility at 23:46 on December 28th 2052. There is no record of him boarding official transport from the facility, and there were no air transports after 23:00 hours last night. This means he is likely in a private vessel. We have extensive patrols monitoring traffic along the Yucatan current, but we believe the target is heading east or north and will stay on the water for as long as possible.

Alert all coastal outposts as far east as Cancun and initiate a VS along both the Loop current and the Florida current. You are approved to use as many resources as necessary to fulfill this task.

The target is carrying extremely hazardous material which must be returned to the client at all costs. Ensure your operatives are wearing full protective gear at all times and follow the latest hazmat regulations.

Should the target make it to Cuba, we will be forced to station agents around the Gulf coast to monitor all points of ingress to the United States. This overt action could compromise the privacy of our client. The target must not escape the net.

Report back once you have initiated the search.
