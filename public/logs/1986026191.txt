Hey Brian,

We've increased the flow-through ventilation but to be safe Lance dropped off extra repellers for us in zone 508. Feel free to use them if as needed. Please report your CMPS readings at every station below 500m.

Also, El Presidente has requested reports on all anomalous readings below 750m - that includes unknown particulate readings, CO2 pockets over 0.6%, or RH readings over 80% . Obviously, if you do enter any areas like that you should leave - but log your readings first or it means another meeting for me.

Cameron
