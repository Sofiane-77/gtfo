This is State of Truth AM. Are you still paying attention? Because it's been a while but... I'm. Still. Here. My last broadcast was 10 weeks ago. Seventy days in the wilderness, longer even than the great man himself. But I did not fast - I feasted. I released my mind from the control of the authority... no... the ENEMY who tried to keep the truth from us. I drew strength from the knowledge that Babylon is burning and we survived. We thrived. We are here and stronger, and more determined, than ever. They awoke the giant my friends. They have opened our eyes and cleared our minds and now we see through their lies so clearly. We know their wicked ways. The memories they plant. The spies... the infiltrators they place in... our lives.

I thank you for the concerned messages you have sent me. I can no longer use phone lines, as I know you understand. For now, I am safe. I am in the Fortress. This is Castle Truth. We have everything we need. Food, water, and a microphone. The world may be falling apart around you my friends, but I will always be here, bringing you the facts. It's all on the table now, now that we know they are lying to us. Aliens, the virus, the burning bodies, poison in the water, false memories, clones, earthquakes, parasites. The horror of it all is all laid bare before us.

Talk to me, my friends. Tell me your truth. Contact StateOfTruth@pm.me. I'm listening.
