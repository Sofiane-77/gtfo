Gustavo,

Thanks for dealing with the Red Cross. They have been removed from the area. Looks like your evac teams didn’t make it as far as Chicxulub. There are a lot of bodies still here. What do you want us to do with them? We can just burn them if you don't want to deal with it.

By the way, our med team assures me they did not die from toxins. Did you use a virus or something?

Andrew.
