NATO collapse imminent 

Report from Mark Howe, blog.mysepticisle.org 

February 2nd 2054 

On the 4th of April, 1949, a New World Order was established. The North Atlantic Treaty was signed, and with it came the now infamous article 5. “The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all". With these simple words, the war-weary people of world were told there would be peace. That there would be no more World Wars, that any separatists who broke the treaty would face the wrath of the combined armed forces of NATO. 

Almost 105 years later, the treaty has faced its most challenging test so far, and it has failed. Not from a rogue power threatening nuclear Armageddon, not from ancient empires holding acting on ancestral grudges, not by a power greater than themselves forcing the dissolution of that once-great entity but by a bug. A tiny, devastating species killer we call NAM-V. 

For months now, countries around the world have pulled back from the world stage and gone into isolation. Even the most notorious of blowhards (I'm looking at you America and Britain) are no longer glibly telling the rest of the world what to do. Every international border has closed, and in many nations new internal borders have been established around ancient land claims and local communities. Yet while these parochial hostilities may pick away at the fabric of our society, it has always seemed repairable once the dreaded NAM-V has had its microbial ass kicked. 

But now, the seams have fallen apart on the party dress. A massive tear has ripped the fabric apart. NATO is no more. 

While there is not, and never will be any official memo from NATO to tell us the party is over, the actions of the member states make it clear it is only a matter of time before full scale war breaks out among not one or two of the original NATO nations - but all of them. My beloved home country, this very Septic Isle, is already sinking refugee ships coming from France, Norway and Germany. Turkey and Greece are at it again, and Cyprus is caught in the crossfire. The Netherlands and Germany are defending their borders with military force and taking pot shots at each other whenever one dares poke their head out of the trenches. Even Spain and Portugal have threatened military action of the other one doesn't do something about those damned refugees. And among all this European chaos is the big daddy of them all, Uncle Sam. Uncle Sam is stone-cold quiet. He's got his own mess to deal with.
