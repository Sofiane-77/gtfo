Mr. Johanson,

With regards to the psychological matching of our operatives, we have found that each designation has a tendency to take a specific role within the Quad. Genesis often establish themselves as leaders within a few minutes, as is to be expected with the increased 5-HT receptors. The designations do allow for flexibility of course. We have several Quads where operatives marked as Faulty have assumed a leadership role, making me question our classification criteria. It may be that our standards are too stringent (excepting injury or physical incapability obviously), and we should be less hasty marking an operative as Faulty when we see mental aberrations. The deviations happen more often when the operative is placed under extreme duress, or if an objective requires extensive violent engagement. I believe we expect too much given their social circumstance prior to acquisition. Despite extensive protein supplements, those embedded behaviors are going to surface and we should develop a curriculum to deal with them rather than throwing them on the trash heap.

Once we move over to Rise operatives, many of the behavioral issues we face with our current operatives will resolve. However, not all of these idiosyncrasies are products of social environment or prolonged hydrostasis. Human nature has a role to play here. As a species, we have a propensity for violence. We divide into tribal groups that are political and encourage leadership competition. We expect some manufactured operatives to congenitally take a beta role, just as we expect others to establish themselves as alphas. If such conflict occurs within a quad - or even worse during a mission - that will be a disaster. A corrective behavior program will be essential to avoid excessive product waste even with a spotless genetic pool to grow from.
