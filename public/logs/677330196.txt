Subject: Spring Break!

All employees,

From all of corporate at Santonian Mining, we want to congratulate you on an excellent first quarter working at the cutting edge of modern ore and mineral extraction!

As a member of the SMC family, your work and dedication play an integral role in our mission of building a better future and a positive, prosperous tomorrow for all mankind.

There have been many challenges this year, and your management team is not blind to the issues facing us over the next few months. It is imperative that each and every employee focuses on their work and pulls together to achieve the common goal. You must make this next quarter really count. Double down on your hours, commit yourself to ideals that SMC aspires to, and let's realize our true potential together.

Despite what you may have heard, we have control of the NAM-V outbreak. While the number of cases is increasing, the virus poses very little threat to you, and we expect herd immunity to develop within the next few months. Despite the low risk, we are asking any staff who show symptoms of a viral infection to report to the medical department as soon as possible. We have set up a new NAM-V trauma center to present an even easier path to recovery for our staff.

We will unfortunately have to cancel all spring leave this year. We cannot risk exposing communities beyond our borders to NAM-V until we have it fully under control. We will be allocating all employees additional surface time to make up for the loss of leave.

Onwards and downwards!

Andrew Clinton
