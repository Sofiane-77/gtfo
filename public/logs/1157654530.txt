RE: RE: RE: Chicxulub accident

There's no inquiry for victims of the earthquake, but bodies piling up in a secret project run by a shady company in a prohibited zone? That's going to get attention. Why would they move the bodies? I want to know what Santonian are doing. Even if this turns out to be another labor abuse story to add to their list, someone needs to give a shit.

RE: RE: Chicxulub accident

Derek,

Are you saying the accident didn't happen where they said it happened? Why would they cover that up?

RE: Chicxulub accident

Fran - I have a source on the inside who's telling me he thinks they're falsifying reports at the Santonian project down in the Yucatan. Jackie sent a newsfeed tweet a few months ago about a mining accident at the Santonian mine (can't find it now but it's on her feed still). My source told me he saw a body being transported from the exclusion zone and taken to the Chicxulub mine on that same day, and that the body was "wet, mangled and bloated".

He also said the exclusion zone is not the one our reporters have been banned from, there’s a SECOND exclusion zone towards the coast that even some Santonian employees can't enter.

I'm thinking there's a bigger project going on there than just iridium mining at Chicxulub and Merida. Can you draw up the latest satellite/topo data you can find on the area? If they're doing something along the coast, environment may find a story there, and if they're moving bodies and falsifying reports, I want that story to myself.
