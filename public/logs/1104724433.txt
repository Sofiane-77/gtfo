"Very few".

There are things you don't know that you don't know. I need a complete list of all pathogens you have exposed to hydrostasis. I have a suspicion your list is not complete.

Angela,

I don't see how pathogens could be influencing the BAT results to be honest. The assessments are carried out after at least 5 days in HS recovery, and very few organisms will survive suspended animation for more than a few days without a finely tuned external subsistence strategy to keep them alive. When we introduce positive bacteriophages we have to stimulate them constantly or they won't survive even a few hours in HS. This is without considering the counteragents and neutralizers we use in the amniotic plasma.

Any behavioral issues you are seeing are psychological, not biological. Nothing survives HS unless we want it to.
