MALE VOICE 1
State of Truth AM. People, I have... I have found something that has rocked me to my core. I don't know if I'm... Am I losing my mind? Or... are there other factors... agents, at play here. Let me... let me play something for you.
[unknown sound]
MALE VOICE 1
Hey you’re on the air with State of Truth AM.
MALE VOICE 2
Hey am I on?
MALE VOICE 1
Yup, you’re on air buddy. What have you got?
MALE VOICE 2
Okay. Okay, I don’t have much time. There’s a… I don’t know if you can hear that… there’s a helicopter been circling for over an hour right above me.
MALE VOICE 1
Yeah I don’t hear anything Caller. You told our screener you had information on the SMC, right?
MALE VOICE 2
Right. Santonian Mining Company. Oh man, I don’t know where to start--
MALE VOICE 1
To be clear, you mean Dreyfus Industries, right? I mean, we’re talking about the same company here and I want to start getting people used to the idea that there’s a big daddy controlling all of this.
MALE VOICE 2
Dreyfus Industries, right. There’s some crazy stuff happening there--
MALE VOICE 1
Where?
MALE VOICE 2
Garganta, man! The Throat. We call it the Facility; it’s got a lot of names--
MALE VOICE 1
We? You work for Dreyfus?
MALE VOICE 2
No. I mean, yes. I worked for SMC but I’m out, man. I had to go. They’re… they’re burning bodies down there…
MALE VOICE 1
Burning bodies, what do you mean?
MALE VOICE 2
They got these explorations, right? They’re digging into something down near Chicxulub--
MALE VOICE 1
Chicxulub, that’s the town they took over, right?
MALE VOICE 2
Yeah, well it’s a town and that big crater, right? Down in the Yucatan--
MALE VOICE 1
Right, we’ve talked about that on air--
MALE VOICE 2
Yeah well, they’re poking around down there and finding all kinds of weird stuff. People going crazy and coming back all mangled and--
MALE VOICE 1
Mangled? What does that mean?
MALE VOICE 2
Like mangled, mutilated. Bones bent and broken, skin changing into I don’t know what… that’s why they’re burning the bodies, to get rid of the evidence.
MALE VOICE 1
What happened to them?
MALE VOICE 2
I don’t know. We thought… my colleagues thought maybe they found something. You know they’re mining for iridium, right?
MALE VOICE 1
Right, but does iridium exposure do that to a body? We don’t know exactly--
MALE VOICE 2
No man, it's not the iridium! That’s what I’m saying! They found something down there!
MALE VOICE 1
You’re saying they found something else?
MALE VOICE 2
No doubt in my mind. We all knew it. That’s why they tightened security. They stopped letting people in… wait--
MALE VOICE 1
Caller? Where’d you go, I lost you?
MALE VOICE 2
Thought I heard something. That helicopter’s freaking me out.
MALE VOICE 1
Okay, try to stay calm, okay pal?
MALE VOICE 2
Okay… okay--
MALE VOICE 1
You said they tightened security? You mean they stopped you from going into parts of the facility?
MALE VOICE 2
Yeah, and they wouldn’t let us leave. I had to escape. Me and a couple of others found a way out and tried to make it to the border--
MALE VOICE 1
Okay there are more of you? Hello? Caller? Did we lose him? Can we get him back? All right, we’ll be back in a moment here. Stay tuned.
[unknown sound]
MALE VOICE 1
I do not remember that, at all. I do not remember the caller, I do not remember saying those words, I do not... No. That is not me. It can't be. It doesn't make any sense... uhh... We'll... we'll be right back.
