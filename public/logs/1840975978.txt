This is State of Truth AM. I want to talk about something... personal today. You know, I can't very well call myself Mr. Truth if I'm not honest with you, can I? Well, for the last few months, I have been... experiencing things that I can't explain. I have memories, memories that I have been told are false. Memories that even Mrs. Truth tells me are in my imagination. These memories are fleeting, but they are clear, precise recollections of events, they are... emotional connections to a truth that on the face of it seems wrong. I recall moments of conversations I have had with people I have no recollection of meeting. I see images of buildings that I have never seen, yet I know the shape. Sometimes, I will know what the caller is about to say the second before they say it. Now, understand me: this is not Deja Vu. This is something that I know, in my gut, is truth - just not the truth of my present, or of this history. I... hmmm... how can I explain? I recall, very clearly, that the Merida quake happened on March 15th 2049. That date is precise and clear in my mind - and it's wrong. The quake happened in April, It's in all the papers, all of the reports, all of the books. The great Merida quake... of April, 2049. I even know what I was doing on the day it happened, and that day was in April, but in my gut, I know it happened in March. I can SEE it. Is there anyone else out there experiencing something similar? Are some things different as you remember them? Tell me I'm not alone in this. Something... has changed. You know the number. Call.
