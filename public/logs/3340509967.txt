Interview with prisoner 172—

VOICE 2
Prisoner?

VOICE 1
We have to evaluate every prisoner.

VOICE 2
I'm not a prisoner.

VOICE 1
That is yet to be confirmed. How did you end up in Valencia?

VOICE 2
I got trapped here when Esparza took over the city. Look I've been stuck here for 3 months! Do you understand? I've been held hostage! I'm the victim here! You need to look me up on the… the Santonian personnel database—

VOICE 1
We have looked you up. There is no record of you working at the Valencia office.

VOICE 2
No. No, that's not true. You've made a mistake—

VOICE 1
They have no record of Frank Bishop ever working for the Santonian Strategic Investments Company.

VOICE 2
I know what's going on. Janson Davies did this to me. That son of a bitch put me here—

VOICE 1
We have spoken to Mr. Davies. He's never heard of you.

VOICE 2
He put me here to shut me up!

VOICE 1
Why would he lie?

VOICE 2
Because I know what Dreyfus did. What HE did. The RX-Zika vaccination? Oh yeah, I know about that. The long term effects. He thinks he can silence me—

VOICE 1
These are serious accusations, Mr. Bishop. For him to send you to a country on the brink of civil war, knowing full well that any foreigners in the city would almost certainly be killed? 

VOICE 2
That's exactly why he put me here! What I know would destroy him. Now I don't care if he destroyed my records, you look me up at the embassy, or you look up my visa paperwork, you'll see I'm not supposed to be here—

VOICE 1
To be clear Mr. Bishop, there are no records of you. No records at all. Anywhere.

VOICE 2
Of course there are! I have a passport! Check the embassy!

VOICE 1
There is no Frank Bishop, born in Lambeth in 2001 to Sam and Evie Bishop. There is no record that you joined SSIC as an intern in 2017—

VOICE 2
What is this—

VOICE 1
—or that you worked for them for 10 years before attempting to blackmail your boss with sensitive information you had gathered from spyware installed on multiple executive laptops.

VOICE 2
So he owns you too, does he?

VOICE 1
There is no record of you being posted to Valencia. Nor is there a Frank Bishop listed among the missing or captured foreign workers.

VOICE 2
When I get out of here, and I will get out of here, I'm going to make you pay. You hear me?

VOICE 1
Mr. Bishop, you don't exist. You never did. Guards!

VOICE 2
Where are you taking me? Get your hands off me! Let go of me you bastards!

VOICE 1
This one's for the Legion.

VOICE 2
What is that? Let me go! No—

VOICE 1
You have nothing to worry about Mr. Bishop. Your ordeal will be a distant memory soon enough. Interview stopped at 2100 hours. End recording.
