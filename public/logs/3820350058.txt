Mass Shooting at Larnaca Base Kills 17
by Gerald Mackee

17 people are dead at a US military base in Larnaca, Cyprus, after a shooting rampage on Saturday morning. Authorities stated that the gunman was eventually stopped by marines having been shot 9 times and is in critical condition at the Lefkosa Hospital in Nicosia.  The name of the assailant has been withheld as part of an official Cypriot “no glory” policy.

The suspect, a supplies clerk, had been stationed at the base for six months prior. Sources close to the suspect called him a “soft spoken religious man”, but also as “exactly the kind of person you expect to read about one day”. Investigators are still investigating how the shooter obtained a Mossberg 590, the weapon used in the attack. Shotguns have not been issued to US forces since 2037 but are popular among enlisted men as an additional combat firearm.

The Pentagon has stated that the suspect has a record of distinguished service and had recently returned to duty after a tour in Erzurum, Turkey. The city was taken by the Caucasus Republic Forces during the invasion in the spring of 2047. Several hundred US soldiers were trapped behind enemy lines after the CRF’s shock invasion of Turkey. Less than twenty US soldiers escaped the country after the coup, and those who did returned with horror stories about the treatment by the CRF, prompting a war crimes investigation by the United Nations.

The Pentagon also stated that the suspect rejected a compassionate honorable discharge after escaping from Turkey, requesting instead an assignment as a supplies clerk. He was then posted to Larnaca, a strategic US hub that supplies the peacekeeping forces stationed along the newly established Turkish/Caucasus border.

Investigators confirmed that the gunman acted alone, said that there are no other suspects at this time.
