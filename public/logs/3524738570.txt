I ran your suggestion past the board, and they have approved it. However, we will not be able to give you Valiant Chamber. It has not yet been fully explored, and the lifeforms we've found there are far too important to Project Insight. However, Santonian will allocate a starting excavation of 3,500,000 for KDS Deep. You can expect that space to be available to you by March.

In the meantime, there is plenty of room available in the surface hangars so you can begin moving your equipment in immediately. There were some concerns over your power requirements, but I'll leave that to you to sort out with Clinton.

I look forward to seeing Legion at work. Speak directly to Clinton if you have any concerns.

Valiant Chamber 7,364,250 cu/m (latest numbers, they're still exploring)
Largest excavation by volume: Probably KDS Deep? KDS Deep location was approximately 4,000,000 cu/m before Kovac rescinded record access.
