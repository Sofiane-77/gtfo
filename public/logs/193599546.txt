Growing Concern over NAM-V
by Duncan Keith

Saturday night at the Manchester Royal Infirmary. Usually, the emergency room sees a steady influx of patients. It's busy; but no more than they can handle. the Infirmary is well staffed and stocked, and has a reputation for dealing with patients quickly and efficiently.

But not tonight. Tonight over 280 people crowd the waiting rooms. As one patient is seen, treated, and released, 2 more take their place at the end of the line. There are no beds left, not enough personal protective equipment for the medical staff, and a barely contained sense of panic among the cast-down faces of those waiting in hope that they don't have "the Stoops". This is a hospital clinging on, desperately trying to weather the storm of the NAM-V virus.

Since the WHO officially labeled the NAM-V virus as a pandemic, the number of reported cases has spiked. That can be partly attributed to a more concerted testing effort, but it is still a sign of just how quickly this virus is spreading. Unlike previous pandemics (Hook, COVID19 - 21, Respo-Z2), this one debilitates its victims. There is no stay-at-home solution. If you have NAM-V, you need professional care. The long-term effects of the virus are still unknown, but once you start to feel the tightening in your bones and the hallucinations you will need medical supervision, or the end will be swift. Medical intervention is the only thing that can slow the decline. Even if the patient does manage to survive the initial onslaught of the virus, it will remain in their system and can strike again without warning.
