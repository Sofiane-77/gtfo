Dean,

The subject's physiological changes do seem to be permanent. The ossification of the fibrous cartilage in both the spine and menisci appears to start at the brain stem and spreads rapidly, possibly due to the greater intercellular space offered. Attempts to slow the spread have so far been unsuccessful.

Affected subjects show signs of cognitive reduction within a few days, which accompanies the bent or stooped posture. They are able to continue menial work for several weeks (possibly longer), before succumbing to the pain and physical disability.

Opiates and derivatives ease the pain of the subjects, and we have been administering liberally as no other form of palliative care appears to work. We have noticed some patients grow particularly sensitive to light and sound, and will scream in pain if disturbed. It is not clear why this behavior is exhibited in some and not others.

The effect on the skeleton is unmitigated and I cannot see any treatment path. I have our entire cellular biology department working on this, but so far little progress has been made. Even after the parasite is removed, the viral load increases. We cannot stop the progress of the virus, and our only defense is SCBA Level A suits when in NAM-V hotspots. Even with this level of protection, the parasites are finding their way in.

Transition from initial diagnosis to cellular collapse takes approximately 6 weeks. We have yet to discover what happens thereafter. I will keep you posted.

We need more oxymorphone. If not, straight morphine. It's the only thing that stops them screaming.
