Hearsay on. I went deeper. Down... I don't know how many levels. I ended up in a place called KDS Deep. I know what it is now, maybe part of me even remembers it. It's a crypt. A huge room, filled with thousands of people locked in hydrostasis units. That's the scientific term for them, but they're coffins. They're filled with the nearly dead, locked in an endless purgatory, their memories and personalities being eaten away, used for some unknown purpose by an AI routine that sees them as nothing more than resources. That saw me, as nothing more than a resource.
I know what happened to me. I was here, and I left a message, for whoever was coming to help, on the Hearsay terminal. Well no one came, and that was seven years ago. Seven years! Seven years of nothing, no memories, no experience, no life. Seven years in the coffin, like the rest of them. The difference is I knew what I was doing. I had a choice. Seven years ago, this facility was being overrun by the same creatures that own it today. I came here, to KDS Deep, and climbed into a hydrostasis unit. I knew what it would do to me, but I did it anyway. I destroyed my life to save it.
Well the person that climbed into that hydrostasis unit may have died that day but I'm not dead. I'm getting the fuck out of here. I'm getting out of here, and I'm taking as many of these poor fuckers as I can with me. I don't know what's outside of this place, but I'm going to find out, and I'm going to find the person that created this nightmare and make them pay.
