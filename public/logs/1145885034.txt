Incident Description
Myself and an unknown Kovac Security Operative (unknown because KSOs apparently do not have to give their name when asked) got into an altercation when he refused me entry to my own sleeping quarters. The security officer informed me that my belongings were being "processed". When I asked what that meant I got no response. I then attempted to gain access to MY OWN QUARTERS and was forcefully prevented entry. I then attempted to push the rent-a-cop out of the way, at which point he twisted my arm behind my back and forced my head to the ground. In doing so he sprained my wrist.

I was held in that uncomfortable position for several minutes despite my complaints, until the security detail who were ransacking my room finished and left. When I was finally allowed to enter my quarters they had deleted all local correspondence (both emails and Hearsay transcripts) from the last 2 months. During those 2 months I have made several reports noting concern over the growing aggression towards Santonian employees by both KSO representatives and Project Insight staff. Those reports are all now gone from my possession, and are presumably gathering digital dust on some HR reps hard drive.

A Hearsay microphone has also been placed INSIDE MY QUARTERS, which has to be illegal, right?

Actions taken after incident
Vitori Molina (C158) subject to ANOTHER disciplinary hearing scheduled for April 30th 2052. Socialization privileges have been suspended pending the hearing. A personal statement from myself has been attached, though I doubt if anyone even reads them anymore.
