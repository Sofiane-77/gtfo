Hearsay on. Umm... I made it to KDS-Deep. I didn't know what I was going to say the KSOs when I get here but... they're all gone. They're not dead, they're in Hydrostasis. There's thousands of them and I can't... I don't know how to wake them up. There's a terminal here but it's that BIOCOM thing and I don't know how that works. I mean fuck aren't they here to protect us. It's been... 7 days. Maybe more. I don't know. I still haven't eaten. When I got here I... I'm a fucking idiot. I closed the door so they wouldn't find me and now I can't get it open. I'm stuck in here, and I'm going to starve to death. I'm so tired. I think.. I think I have to get into one of these pods. Oh fucking hell, I know what these do to you. Everyone fucking knows, it's no secret. If someone ever comes to get me out, it won't be me any more. But fuck, I'm not going to starve to death. Fuck it. I hope you made it, Art.
