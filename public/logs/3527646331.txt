Mr. Davies,

As the initial survey suggested, there’s a sediment layer running from dig site 10F (just north of Chicxulub) out to a few kilometers off the coast. The survey fleet has confirmed there’s a huge deposit at the end of the vein with a mass that’s 1.5 - 2k meters wide, and up to 4k down (our scans can’t penetrate all the way through the mass) We’ll get more accurate data once we get the MODU situated.

If the density is consistent, we could be looking at upwards of 4,000 tons. A conservative estimate puts that at 300 billion at today’s Iridium price.

I’ll send you the blueprints of Garganta later this week. We weren't expecting such a large vein so we're adjusting on the fly.

Back to it,

Andrew.
