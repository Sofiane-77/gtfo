Ms. Gabris,

Mr. Davies has informed me that the deal with Nyxos has been finalized, and that you will be my contact for the foreseeable future.

The get you up to speed, we expect to begin drilling the main shaft in the next 5 weeks or so. Our expected progress will be approximately 5-7 meters per day, with a target depth of 1500 meters being reached by July 2051. July is a drop-dead date. We will have completed the main shaft by then, which means that all Nyxos materials and equipment need to be on site by August 1st 2051 at the latest. If for any reason you have problems fulfilling the orders or with transportation to the site, you need to let me know immediately. We run a tight ship at SMC and expect our partners to match our professionalism and diligence.

Also, a word about security clearance. Though you have been cleared up to Tier 3, your staff and workforce have not. I expect all of your employees to be fully informed of which areas of Garganta are off limits. Any personnel found without clearance in a restricted zone will be removed from the facility immediately and will face criminal prosecution. Both Mr. Davies and I will be holding you fully responsible for the movements and discretion of your team during the project.

Now that that's out of the way, welcome to Garganta, the most cutting-edge mining and research facility ever built. Santonian Mining is proud to be partnered with Nyxos. We're going to do great things together. See you at the Complex!

Andrew Clinton B035.
