Hey John,

I've tried speaking to my pit boss about this but Harris is useless so I'm letting you know personally so this crap doesn't come back on me.

Work has slowed to a crawl. We hit a slab of solid material and nothing is getting through it. Geo warned us that something was up ahead but this stuff is harder than diamond. It's destroying our gear. I'm not getting any help from the Nyxos people. They will only talk directly to Gabris, who will only speak directly to you.

The tooth sets we're using just aren't strong enough. We break 3 of them a day, minimum. Each tooth takes at least 2 hours to replace because half of our engineers are out with the stoops, plus we have to back off the mole and go through the startup/shut down procedure every time. There's no way we're going to be at target depth in 3 months at this rate. We're currently drilling less than a meter a day.

I really don't want to come to you with this stuff, but I know you're going to see the numbers of the last week and wonder what the hell's going on. Can you speak to Nyxos? See if they have any tooth sets using stronger material? At least have Geo give me some details on the rock we're breaking our shit on so maybe I can figure out a plan B? My hands are tied here.
