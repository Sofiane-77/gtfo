Statement from Dr Gloria Rutermayer, WHO Regional Director for Europe

14 March 2053, Copenhagen, Denmark

With the NAM-V outbreak in Manchester, England, the World health Organization is now declaring the NAM-V virus as a phase 6 global pandemic. The virus is no longer confined to just Mexico and the United States and has spread to a new WHO region.

Keep yourself and others safe.
Wash hands regularly
Wear a mask
Practice Social Distancing
Inform local authorities of any known cases of NAM-V

Your commitment to following these guidelines WILL SAVE LIVES.

The risks of getting NAM-V are substantially higher in inadequately ventilated spaces where infected people spend even short periods of time together in close proximity. The R-Naught of NAM-V is currently at 17, making it one of the most infectious contagions in human history. There is currently no known cure for NAM-V, and treatment options are limited.

The WHO are tracing the origins of the virus to learn more about its spread, and are requesting the help of any and all national health agencies. If we can find the earliest cases, we may be able to identify the host that first carried the virus. It is unknown whether the original host was an animal or a plant.

As the search for Patient Zero continues, the WHO is reminding all nations that contact tracing is of the utmost importance as soon as any cases of viral infections have been documented: WHETHER CONFIRMED AS NAM-V OR NOT

Although the virus has currently only been detected in the United States, Mexico, and the United Kingdom, there is a 90% probability that the virus is present in all continents.
