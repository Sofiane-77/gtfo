>>ENC: [Corrupted] report of Dr. Gallus Hammers%%in, lead researcher and co-founder of Project Insight.  I have authorized expeditions #**(= _he following zones 3Q the vessel:

 The location catalogued as "The Gallery"
 The location catalogued as "The Bridge"

These locations are collectively part of what I am calling "the Inner". This area has a separate classification due to evidence of geologic compacting and sedimentary settling. This implies an ancient impact or explosion. You may read my report titled "Life From Beyond" for further information on those findings.

Having pinpointed the location of several chambers in #&%<<976{{Ua ZZve approved a comprehensive mapping and exploration of those zones. I am certain these chambers $#@b%&%BT_& Pf natural geologic processes. An initial report, by one of my staff (not me) suggested that despite the initial GPR scans, they must be lava tunnels. I have rejected that conclusion as there is no evidence of volcanic activity in this area and the chambers are too symmetrical to have been formed by any natural mechanism.

I am now positive w4 #%())87U _vidence of an alien structure. I am confident that the chambers were been constructed by ent$7V* curr3ntly calling The CollectOrs, though, as yet, we do not know how or why they wer! made.

I have ordered any objects found within the Inner to remain in situ for the time being. It is my responsibility to es%^^\\lish protocols for all future explorations, so we will start as if we were |]eshmen archeologists, shifting soil for the first time. We will organize and classify first, then once more is known we shall consider excavation, removal, and transportation. As I believe any artifacts we find will be [redacted], we will need to stay alert to the possibility of [redacted].

We have established a new catalogue for this work. My staff suggested we call it the Hammerstein Collection. It seems as4
