Hearsay on. Regarding the quantum frequency anomaly from the final E-F-Zero-One data burst. We traditionally overcomplicate quantum superposition. At its most basic, it is just a simple addition of two states to create a new position. However, this simplification relies on an assumed consistency of universal physical law. It understands time on a linear scale, and a given quantum superposition is true in that instance only… but what if we look beyond that? What if the waves that meet and create new superpositions are not from the same timeline? Time has always been the division. They cannot meet as they occurred at a different time, but what if that law is only true while dimensionally restricted? If a wave from a different dimension meets another wave from a different dimension, the superposition that occurs in theory could be identical to a superposition that occurs in our known dimension. And if the differentiator between these dimensions is the quantum frequency, that dimension's perception of the passage of time, in theory that identical superposition could happen an infinite number of times and, in theory, might even have some predictability. If something is predictable, it can be prepared for. A mechanic can be devised to control and manipulate it. If you know where a particle is going to be in your dimension, you can monitor that superposition for quantum frequency variations and record other timelines. Perhaps the Matter Wave Projector does exactly this. It tethers itself to a superposition that will happen in the future, and when that moment arrives, it switches waves and continues a new journey, in a new frequency, with a new set of universal laws. This would explain why some teleported artifacts appear to enmesh with each other. Matter from different dimensions could get amalgamated or… or enmeshed as it occupies identical space-time for an instance. Chaos. Unpredictability from a predictable occurrence. If this happened to Durant and his team, then who knows where or when they ended up? Or if they survived. He may have enmeshed with himself or teleported to a dimension where every physical law is set to a new quantum frequency. He could be 100 years old now or have died in an instant. He could have teleported to another dimension then back to our own where a second superposition on the same wave occurred. He could be in tomorrow, or 1000 years in the past. Hearsay off.
