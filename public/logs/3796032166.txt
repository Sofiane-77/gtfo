To all Garganta employees,

There will be changes coming in the next few months as Project Insight assumes control of all deep level operations. We will be restricting free access throughout the facility to personnel with Tier 5 security clearance only.

All work carried out in restricted areas will follow a strict "nothing-in-nothing-out" policy. Tools and equipment required for fabricating, repairs, installation, maintenance, or any other work will need to be pre-approved and screened. All personnel below Tier 5 with clearance papers will be scanned and searched on entry to the lower levels, and on exit.

There will be extensive construction works going on in the restricted zone. If you have been assigned to a work crew within a restricted area, please contact your sub-level administrator for further guidance on policy and movement through T5 areas. There will be a no tolerance enforcement policy, so you are expected to understand and follow the rules. These measures are being taken to ensure you continue to have a safe and productive work environment.

All request forms, security documents and inquiries should be directed to our operations center.

Thank you for the warm welcome we have received so far. If you have any questions or concerns, our door is always open.

Dean Lockwood
Project Insight Director of Operations
