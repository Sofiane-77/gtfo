Dear readers,

It is with great sadness that we announce that today marks the final publication of the Liberty Sentinel. We do not know how much longer the internet will be available, and with only a few core staff members remaining, we believe the time has come to close our doors. After decades of providing unbiased news and inciteful reporting to our loyal readers, we must now say goodbye.

For nearly 300 years, the United States has been the cornerstone of democracy, providing stability and direction for the rest of the world. When called upon, America has answered, time after time, generation after generation. For the first time in our nation's history, we can no longer answer the call to action.

The collapse of our government has left many wondering what the future holds and how we will move forward. While our seats of power may be in disarray, we believe the ideals that built America are strong within those of us that remain. In these uncertain times, we still hold hope that the nation can come together and work towards a solution. It is up to each and every one of us to ensure that our democracy survives and that we emerge from this pandemic stronger than ever.
You are now the Sentinels, guarding steadfastly the ideals and morals that built this great country. You must hold aloft the beacon of hope and the symbols of our identity so that in the future, we may rebuild our society. The American dream, whose embers still glow in the ashes, need you. Give us the seeds, and we shall sow.

Until we meet again.

Sincerely,

The Staff of the Liberty Sentinel
