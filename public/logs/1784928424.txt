Sector analysis complete.

MSL report K-UX-DeepScan-4-7-52 follows:

The mass extends 2,215 (+/- 372m) meters from apex to nadir. The width estimate is 1,246 meters (+/- 184m). As suspected, the object is largely made up of the newly discovered Cretasium 77a material and surrounded by a thin membrane of iridium. Further analysis is required to determine if the material composition mirrors the artifacts. The data suggests the composition of the object is not identical to the artifacts, but shares properties. This suggests a similar origin.

Spectroscopy reveals massive internal vaulting, most likely of artificial origin. Form and scale incongruent with human construction.

Core composition analysis follows:

cretasium 77a: 38.60%
oxygen: 27.34%
silicon: 12.12%
aluminum: 5.13%
iridium: 3.32%
sodium: 3.26%
calcium: 2.57%
potassium: 2.10%
magnesium: 2.03%
titanium: 1.14%
hydrogen: 0.93%
phosphorous: 0.77%
carbon: 0.54%
+trace strontium, barium, manganese, fluorine, sulfur, zirconium, tungsten, chlorine, copper, nickel, nitrogen, zinc.

It is safe to assume that standard excavation methods will not work given the results of the artifact analysis. We should upgrade the mine   teams with Nyxos cutters. Environmental conditions inside the object are unknown, so hermetic precautions must be taken.

Additional: Several large, clear tubes can be seen on the true color gamma print, starting at the approximate center point of the mass. They do not appear to be lava tubes; the composition materials are too dense to be affected by any heat generated by volcanic activity. Further analysis is needed once we excavate. GSP data for the largest of these tubes has been sent to operations.
