CONNOR
Hearsay on. We have destroyed the world, and there will be no one left to hold us accountable. The board made that very clear. Some of the team have families and are insisting they be allowed to leave, but they won’t let us go. We will die here; unless, somehow, we find a way to stop this virus. The answer has to be in the Inner, I know it.  There’s an area we've sealed off with several bulkheads; a chamber with a biomass larger than anything we've seen before. Thousands of biosigs and at least one unknown, massive, organism. We've avoided dealing with it, but we’re out of time. Tomorrow. We have to face it, and this time I'm going with them. I refuse to die a cautious man. I choose to fight. Tomorrow, we open the doors. Hearsay off.
