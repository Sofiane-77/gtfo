Shafe,

I've processed the environmental data collected over the last 3 years, and there is no record of anything like we're seeing now. The temperature readings are off the charts - way in excess of the variance we expected at 2000. The cooling system is being pushed past max just to keep the lowest levels tolerable. There is constant seismic activity that the geos assure me does not mean the entire place is about to collapse, but when you're in one of those tremors that doesn't bring me any comfort.

I don't know where you've posted your teams at the moment, but if they're below 2000+ you might want to pull them out.

I'm installing the system that I told you about for our mutual boss. I'm going deep on this one - and it is really, really uncomfortable down here. This place makes you want to scratch the inside of your head.

Honestly, I think they're hitting some kind of geothermal mass but everyone's too afraid to say anything. If our probes are closing in on a geological anomaly with unknown properties, I feel like energy spikes, temperature fluctuations, seismic activity, and a shared sense of doom and fear would be a big tell, right?

Is everything okay by the way? You didn't reply to my last email. Watsupwitdat?

Hit me back.

Artus
