Andre,

Whatever you said to Sullivan worked. I haven't heard a peep out of him all day. Thank you.

I would like to increase KDS presence for all expeditions as we explore the Inner. We are encountering creatures on practically every outing now, and my staff are not equipped to deal with them. Would you have the resources to send an operative team for all future expeditions into the object?

Dean
