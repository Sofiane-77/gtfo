TEALE
Try to stay calm, Jordy.

E257
Calm. Calm calm calm. Keep hearing that word. Nothing is calm, you understand.

TEALE
Yes.

E257
No. No. How could you. You don’t have the slightest idea of... [inaudible]... going on down there. It’s this… there’s this constant noise. Right.

TEALE
Right.

E257
Wrong. You don’t hear it, you don’t know.

TEALE
Okay. I’m sorry. Let’s talk about the noise.

E257
It’s… scratching. Eating. Something in my ear. Like earwigs in the brain, right. You know that story, right.

TEALE
What story.

E257
Jesus. Earwigs in the brain.

TEALE
I don’t.

E257
Earwigs can’t turn round. So if they get in your ear they just eat their way through. They can’t turn around. They can’t go back. Okay.

TEALE
I don’t think earwigs do that.

E257
It’s… it’s what I’m hearing. Why do I come here anyway.

TEALE
I’m here to offer my help. If you need someone.

E257
Oh I know. Yeah. “We’re here to help”. Fuck you, you’re part of it.

TEALE
Part of what.

E257
You know exactly what I’m talking about.

TEALE
HearSay off.
